Overview
This project is a demonstration of how to create a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It consists of a front-end built with React.js, a back-end server built with Node.js and Express.js, and a MongoDB database for data storage. The application showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations allowing users to interact with data through a user-friendly interface.

Features
User authentication: Allows users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
CRUD operations: Provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.
Responsive design: Ensures optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
RESTful API: Implements a RESTful API for communication between the client and server.
Error handling: Includes comprehensive error handling both on the client and server sides.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible remotely.
understanding of JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
